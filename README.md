# RHDE-3: Deploying MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge Quick Course

This course teaches how to deploy and configure MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge targets, using either traditional RHEL or RHEL for Edge, to support Kubernetes applications.

Sample applications and configuration files are in the [rhde-build-samples](https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/tree/main) repository.

The course design docs are available to Red Hat employees only:

* [Initial course design](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zPUVBdbdlMEUlMmlsnDLiIjOtUMPBXYe3b2TO_Xhl6M/edit?usp=sharing)

Figures on this course are designed using Google Slides, and the deck is available to Red Hat employees. Individual slides are exported to SVG files and cleaned using Inkscape. Those files are in the git repository.

Refer to the [Red Hat Quick Courses Contributor Guide](https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/welcome/1/guide/overview.html) for instructions about collaborating in this repository.

The virtual classroom environment is a work in progress and its not yet available to leaners. It is available for development as HOL014 from the [Novello Shell](https://docs.google.com/document/d/191nIIcm9vteM-1RQKrbwm-4A-kqZBQfKUlX88Z3Nl6o/edit?usp=sharing). This page will be updated as soon as the HOL014 classroom is available to learners, and it will be available to Red Hatters and partners, and also customers with a Red Hat Learning Subscription.

See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WzCPaNG-IPubtlqYtvQlz6XHVVWtDZscWSBqwgLDzmo/edit?usp=sharing) notes about the progress on creating a classroom environment customized for the requirements of this and other RHDE courses.
