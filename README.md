# RHDE-3: Deploying MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge Quick Course

This course teaches how to deploy and configure MicroShift on Red Hat Device Edge targets, using either traditional RHEL or RHEL for Edge, to support Kubernetes applications.

WARNING: Sections and partials of this course are also used by [rhde-microshift-bootc]https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-microshift-bootc. When making updates, consider if the changes are generic to MicroShift, or are specific to either RPM-OSTree or RHEL image mode.

Sample applications and configuration files are in the [rhde-build-samples](https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/tree/main) repository.

The virtual classroom environment is a ROLE classroom, which are shared by all Red Hat Device Edge quick courses and will be updated as required by future related courses: *HOL014: Red Hat Device Edge Quick Course Series*. This virtual classroom is available to Red Hatters and partners, and also customers with a Red Hat Learning Subscription.

See [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WzCPaNG-IPubtlqYtvQlz6XHVVWtDZscWSBqwgLDzmo/edit?usp=sharing) notes about the progress on creating a classroom environment customized for the requirements of this and other RHDE courses.
