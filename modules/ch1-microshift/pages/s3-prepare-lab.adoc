= Lab: Prepare a Test Environment for MicroShift

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Prepare a test environment for air-gapped deploment of MicroShift in both package-based RHEL and RHEL for Edge.

WARNING: Work In Progress

== Before you Begin

You need a few different machines to perform the hands-on activities in this course. 

* A _development machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, where you will install Image Builder and RPM-OSTree tools, create test VMs using libvirt, and also run the OpenShift client to access your MicroShift instances in other machines.

* A _test machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, where you will install MicroShift on package-based RHEL.

* A _package server machine_ already configured to serve DNF repositories for RHEL BaseOS, RHEL AppStream, RHEL Fast Data Path, and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

* A _web server machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, to host OSTree repositories

* A _mirror registry machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, to host a https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-mirror-registry-for-red-hat-openshift[mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift].

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.5 [tentative!] but should work with minimal or no change on newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course environment, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`. The `workstation` VM is your _development machine_. You will start SSH sessions from `workstation` VM to the `serverb` VM, which is your _test machine_, using the same user. In the same way, your will start SSH sessions to the `servera` VM, which is your _web server machine_ and also your _mirror registry machine_. 

In the course environment, the `classroom` VM, with the `materials` alias, is your _package server machine_ but you are _not_ expected to start SSH sessions nor perform any activity on it.

If you are using the same course enviroment where you performed the activities from the https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhde-build/rhde-build/1/index.html[Building Red Hat Device Edge Images] quick course, you'll have some requirements already set up. They are listed here anyway, for learners that are starting this course in a new course environment.

NOTE: It should be possible to perform all activities in this course using a Red Hat Developers free subscrition [ADD LINK], which gives you access to installation media, RPM packages, and container images for RHEL and Red Hat OpenShift. If you ignore the requirements for air-gapped installation of MicroShift, you could use a single RHEL VM and adapt the steps to your own environment.

== Instructions

1. Configure your _development machine_ with the RHEL for Edge and libvirt tools. It should be ready if you already performed the activities from the previous course on the same classroom environment.

If something goes wrong while performing these steps and you need troubleshooting aid, please refer to the https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhde-build/rhde-build/1/ch1-build/s4-install-lab.html[previous course] which focus on Image Builder and RPM-OSTree.

.. Install the RPM packages for the Image Builder service and its CLI. Notice that RPM-OSTree pacakges are also installed, as dependencies.

$ *sudo dnf install osbuild-composer composer-cli*

.. Optionally, install the RPM packages for the Cockpit service and its Composer module.

$ *sudo dnf install cockpit cockpit-composer*

.. Enable and activate the Image Builder socket.

$ *sudo systemctl enable osbuild-composer.socket --now*

.. Optionally, enable and activate the Cockpit socket and enable remote access to Cockpit.

$ *sudo firewall-cmd --reload*

.. Grant your unpriviged user (the `student` user) with access to the Image Builder service.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo usermod -a -G weldr student*

.. Configure your unpriviged user with bash command autocompletion for the Image Builder CLI.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *echo 'source /etc/bash_completion.d/composer-cli' >> $HOME/.bashrc*
--

.. Log out and log in again, then verify that autocompletion works for the Image Builder CLI

2. Configure your _web server machine_ to host OSTree repositories. It should be ready if you already performed the activities from the previous course on the same classroom environment.

3. Configure your _web server machine_ with a mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift. These steps are required for _both_ kinds of MicroShift deployment: on package-based RHEL and on RHEL for Edge system images.

4. Check that your _package server machine_ is already set up with all artifacts required for air-gapped installation of MicroShift. These steps are required for _both_ kinds of MicroShift deployment: on package-based RHEL and on RHEL for Edge system images.
