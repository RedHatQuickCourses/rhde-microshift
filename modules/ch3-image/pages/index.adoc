= Deploy MicroShift on Edge Devices

Goal::
Add MicroShift to RHEL for Edge Images

== Introduction

This chapter explores the requirements for building edge system images which include MicroShift, as supported by Red Hat build of MicroShift, including the caveats applicable to air-gaped environments.

The hands-on activities build edge commit and edge installer images with configure MicroShift and test them using RHEL VMs.

IMPORTANT: Most details about installing and configuring MicroShift are explained in the xref:ch2-package[previous chapter]. While you could perform all hands-on activities here without doing the previous chapter, you may lack essential concepts and troubleshooting guidance for managing MicroShift instances.
