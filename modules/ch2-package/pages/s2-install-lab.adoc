= Lab: Install MicroShift from RPM Packages

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Install MicroShift in a RHEL VM that is _not_ connected to the internet.

WARNING: Work In Progress

== Before You Begin

You need a _test machine_ with RHEL and unrestricted `sudo`, on which you will install MicroShift.

You also need a _package server machine_ already configured to serve DNF repositories for RHEL BaseOS, RHEL AppStream, Fast Data Path, and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Make sure that your _package server machine_ is properly configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-microshift:s3-prepare-lab.adoc[first lab] of this course.

Finally, you need a _mirror registry machine_, already configured with a mirror registry for Red Hat OpenShift and pre-populated with container images required by MicroShift and course activities. Make sure that your _mirror registry machine_ is properly configured and verified by following the instructions from the xref:ch1-microshift:s3-prepare-lab.adoc[first lab] of this course.

These instructions were tested on RHEL 9.4, [tentative!] but should work with minimal or no changes on newer and older RHEL 9.x releases.

If you are using the course classroom, you will log in on the `workstation` VM as the user `student` with password `student`, and you start SSH sessions from `workstation` VM to the `serverb` VM, which is your _test machine_, using the same user. If not, please adapt the instructions to your test environment.

You will perform all steps in this lab on your _test machine_.

== Instructions

1. Log in on your _test machine_ and verify that it has access to the required DNF package repositories.

.. Check that the required package repositories from RHEL and OpenShift are available.
+
If you were connected to the internet, or to a Red Hat Satellite instance, and had registered your _test machine_ with a valid Red Hat subscription, you would see something similar to:
+

rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms                                Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
rhel-9-for-x86_64-baseos-rpms                                   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)
rhocp-4.17-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms                               Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.17 for RHEL 9 x86_64 (RPMs)
--
+
IMPORTANT: Please do _not_ register any VM on your virtual labs. Conserve the limited internet bandwidth that is shared by all learners using ROLE.
+
On the classroom environment, you will find configuration files which point to the _package server machine_ and the names of its DNF repositories match the names of Red Hat DNF repositories.
+

$ *cat /etc/yum.repos.d/ocp4.repo*

--

.. As an additional validation, search for packages from the OpenShift and RHEL Fast Data Path repositories.

...
ovn24.09-central.x86_64 : Open Virtual Network support
--

2. Verify that your _test machine_ can access a mirror container image registry that is pre-populated with the container images required by MicroShift.

.. Install the `container-tools` package, if it is not already installed on your _test machine_. This is _not_ strictly required to run MicroShift; however, it provides troubleshooting tools, which can be valuable in a development environment.
+
NOTE: If you receive a prompt on your _test machine_ about importing GPG keys, answer "y".
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo dnf install container-tools*
...
Complete!
--

.. Download a pull secret, which enables access to the MicroShift container images.
+
In a system connected to the internet, you would get a pull secret from your Red Hat account from the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console.
+
IMPORTANT: Please do _not_ use your pull secret with VMs on your virtual labs. Stick to the scenario of an air-gapped deployment of MicroShift and assume that an IT Operations team already configured all local network infrastructure required for deploying Red Hat Device Edge.
+
For the classroom environment, the pull secret for the mirror registry is available from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhde-build-samples/refs/heads/main/microshift/mirror-pull-secret[GitHub]
+
Check that the pull registry contains credentials for `registry.lab.example.com`.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *cat mirror-pull-secret*
include::1@samples:microshift:example$mirror-pull-secret[]
--
+
Encoded in the `auth` field of that pull secret are the `microshift` username and the `redhat123` password.

.. Add the CA key of the mirror registry to the set of trusted CAs. The public CA key is available from the _web server machine_, which in the classroom environment is `servera`, in the `http://servera.lab.example.com/quay-rootCA.pem` URL.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sudo cp quay-rootCA.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors*
$ *sudo update-ca-trust*
--

.. Check that you can use the pull secret to inspect container images on the mirror registry. It should work with TLS validation enabled, which is the default for all container tools.
+
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *skopeo inspect --authfile mirror-pull-secret -f '{{.RepoTags}}' docker://registry.lab.example.com:8443/ubi9/ubi*
[latest]
--
+
NOTE: The command above would work with your actual Red Hat pull secret if you change the registry part of the container image name to `redhat.registry.io`, but displaying a long list of tags.

4. Verify that your _test machine_ is configured to support the installation of MicroShift.

.. First of all, MicroShift expects that SELinux is enabled, in enforcing mode, and that Firewalld is enabled. Please to not disable any of them, you there's no need!
+

+
Enable more services and trusted zones or interfaces as you need. Later in this course we'll show what to add to enable remote access to MicroShift and Kubernetes applications on it.

.. Check that you have two CPU cores, or two virtual CPUs, and at least 2GB of memory. If you are using the classroom environment, you have more memory than required on the `serverb` VM.

5. Install the MicroShift packages.
+
You need only one package, called `microshift`, but pay attention to its dependency list. You will see packages from OpenShift, such as `cri-o`; packages from RHEL for Edge, like `greenboot`; and also packages from Fast Data Path for RHEL 9, which provide Open Virtual Networking (OVN).

The output will be longer as you create more pods, because each one gets a virtual network interface. Notice the two kernel bridges, named `br-ex` and `br-int`, and the OVN switch, named `ovn-k8s-mp0`.

.. Check the presence of the routing rules which enable communication between your real networks and Kubernetes virtual networks.

You now have a fully functional deployment of MicroShift in a RHEL machine. If you find that any of the MicroShift pods failed to start, the most likely cause is an error in your registry mirror and image policy configurations.

IMPORTANT: The way we configured MicroShift, it does _not_ contain a pull secret to download container images from Red Hat, even if it has access to the Internet. It can only pull containers from a mirror registry, which is usually what organizations with strict security policies would demand.

== Next Steps

You probably don't want to perform development from the machine running MicroShift, so the next activity will configure MicroShift for remote access and also an unprivileged user, without full Kubernetes administration rights.
