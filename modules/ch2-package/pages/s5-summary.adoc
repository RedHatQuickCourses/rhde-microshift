= Summary

In this chapter, you learned:

* You install and configure MicroShift as you would any other system service in RHEL. The only prerequisite is having unallocated space in a volume group for use by Kubernetes persistent volumes.

* The lack of application platform components and APIs from OpenShift, such as the OAuth server and Projects API, affects the day-to-day tasks of developer users.

* Red Hat recommends using unprivileged service account tokens and, if necessary, Kubernetes impersonation, to deploy applications and manage MicroShift clusters.

* Once you have a kubeconfig file and access rights to a namespace, you use MicroShift as you would any other Kubernetes. You use MicroShift in  mostly the same way as you would Red Hat OpenShift.
